# ket text editor

This is a text editor implemented with Rust.
I make this repo for practice.

## Features

- create new text file
- modify text file

## Key Map

- arrow keys for cursor movement
- Ctrl-q to quit
- Ctrl-s to save

## How to Use

You can use `cargo build` to build a binary executable file,
`cd` to the target directory and run `./ket` to edit new text file,
or `./ket [file_name]` to modify it.

Or just type `cargo run` or `cargo run -- [file_name]`.

Optionally, you can use `cargo install` to install `ket` on your computer.
